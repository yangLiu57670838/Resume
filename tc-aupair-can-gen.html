<p>This Agreement is made between The Global Work & Travel Co. Inc. (Inc.#: BC0848469 & Travel Agent License: 66496) (GLOBAL) and the Customer (I/ME/MY).</p>

<p>I understand and agree to the following Booking Terms & Conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Personal details</strong></p>
<p>1. I am the Customer completing this booking on MY own behalf.</p>
<p>2. I confirm that I have answered all questions by myself and all information I have provided is true and correct.<p/>
<p>3. I confirm that I have obtained MY own independent, professional advice about passport, visa and health issues and that I am within the required age bracket and without any criminal convictions that would make ME ineligible for MY appropriate visa or entry permits when booking this trip.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Services</strong></p>
<p>4. I engage GLOBAL to help ME organize MY overseas travel arrangements and provide a range of travel, arrival or ongoing support services for or in MY destination country for the purposes of cultural exchange. While GLOBAL will use its best endeavours to help ME in a timely manner no guarantee is given that GLOBAL will be successful in this endeavour.</p>
<p><strong>Payment and Cancellations</strong></p>
<p>5. A deposit of up to $595 is required to book MY trip package. By submitting this form I agree to these Booking Terms & Conditions and understand that the deposit becomes non-refundable if I decide to cancel or not proceed with MY booking or MY trip. MY deposit is refundable if I do not submit this form. MY deposit remains eligible for GLOBAL’s 10 Year Deposit Guarantee as published on the GLOBAL website.</p>
<p>6. MY trip balance is due before MY details are forwarded to the Destination Office.</p>
<p>7. Should I cancel MY booking more than 60 days prior to MY scheduled arrival date in MY destination country, a cancellation fee of 50% of the trip package balance applies. The trip package balance is the amount between the initial deposit and the total chosen trip package price.</p>
<p>8. Should I cancel MY booking 60 days or less from MY scheduled arrival date in MY destination country, a cancellation fee of 100% applies. All other payments made to GLOBAL over and above the listed trip package price, such as airfares and travel insurance, can only be transferred into a Travel Credit to be used towards other travel products and services offered by GLOBAL, subject to applicable third party cancellation fees at time of cancelling.</p>
<p><strong>Job Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>9. A job opportunity is defined as a request from a potential host family to interview ME either via telephone, Skype or in-person, or an employment offer made by a host family.</p>
<p>10. I may be introduced to job opportunities based on MY previous work experience, attitude and planned time spent in the destination country. However, it is MY responsibility to secure and sustain MY employment. I will not hold GLOBAL responsible for the outcome of MY trip should I not respond to job opportunities, purposely or unwillingly reject job opportunities, or act in a way that hinders or prevents the commencement of MY employment resulting from any job opportunity.</p>
<p>11. I have not been given any guarantees on potential job opportunity locations, positions, pay rates or additional benefits, i.e. free transport, or other job perks that may be offered by a potential host family to ME. Should I be unclear on this condition, I will speak to a GLOBAL representative for clarification before submitting this form and booking MY trip.</p>
<p>12. GLOBAL is not and does not purport or hold itself to be an employment or recruitment agency. GLOBAL and third parties assist ME for the purposes of cultural exchange and in order to help ME make the most of MY journey overseas, which might include introducing ME to job opportunities GLOBAL or third parties have become aware of. I understand that GLOBAL does not offer to find ME employment or to negotiate or administer the terms of MY job opportunities or employment contracts. GLOBAL has no control over the employment process and I understand that GLOBAL does not guarantee that I will be suitable for employment, or obtain employment, with a particular host family. Should I be unsuccessful in MY initial job opportunity GLOBAL may, at its sole discretion and depending on job opportunities available at the time, introduce ME to further opportunities with other host families until all avenues have been exhausted, however, I will not hold GLOBAL liable or responsible for the outcome of MY job application with any host family identified to ME as a job opportunity during MY trip.</p>
<p>13. GLOBAL does not charge ME a fee for attempting to secure or securing ME employment nor am I required to use any services or resources offered through GLOBAL. All payments made to GLOBAL are for travel related products and support services for the purposes of a cultural exchange that will be available to ME during MY participation in the trip. GLOBAL is not an employment agent and does not hold itself out to be as such. I acknowledge that there is no relationship of employer and employee between ME and GLOBAL.</p>
<p><strong>Documents</strong></p>
<p>14. It is MY responsibility to provide GLOBAL with all documents requested by GLOBAL in order to receive the travel and support services. Failure to supply those documents and materials does not free ME from MY contractual payment obligations with GLOBAL.</p>
<p><strong>Flights and Travel Insurance</strong></p>
<p>15. Based on the nature of the trip, arrival and ongoing support services, visa requirements and time frames, I understand that it is in MY best interest to make all MY travel arrangements and to purchase MY travel insurance through GLOBAL. I understand and accept that if or when I purchase MY own flights or travel insurance, ALL trip package inclusions will be put on hold until I have provided GLOBAL with MY confirmed itinerary AND Certificate of Insurance valid for the full duration of MY stay overseas. I understand that I must provide GLOBAL with all required documents, including copy of e-ticket and proof of travel insurance at least 60 days prior to MY departure. In addition I may have to check-in with the Destination Office after MY arrival in order to access any job opportunities. I also understand that GLOBAL will not have the flexibility of changing MY travel arrangements to suit the trip operation schedule once booked through a 3rd party provider, and I may have to incur additional costs at MY own expense.</p>

<p>16. In order to receive all applicable trip inclusions, MY trip balance, airfares, insurance and required documents including visa permit, are required to be settled at least 60 days prior to MY scheduled departure, and I must arrive at the recommended international or domestic airport. Should I book MY flights to arrive at another airport, some program inclusions may be transferable, but not all.</p>
<p>17. It is MY responsibility to make sure all airline tickets are issued in MY name and as shown in MY passport and that all itinerary details and travel information are correct.</p>
<p>18. I acknowledge that there is an arrival blackout period from December 15 to January 15, during which time many, if not all, arrival and support services may be reduced or unavailable. It is therefore suggested to arrive well in advance or after this period.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioural Expectations</strong></p>
<p>19. GLOBAL expressly reserves the right to withdraw its ongoing support services should I display verbal or physical behaviour that is commonly unacceptable. Upon MY arrival in MY destination country I will be required to enter into a ‘Behavioural Agreement’ that among others, defines commonly acceptable and expected behaviour and breach of that agreement may result in GLOBAL removing ME from the trip and withholding all further ongoing support and travel services.</p>
<p>20. Unlawful or other acts committed by ME may affect MY trip outcome and may result in termination of MY employment directly with a host family and, if applicable, deportation at MY own risk & expense. GLOBAL will not be liable to cover any costs should I need or decide to return home early.</p>
<p><strong>Liability</strong></p>
<p>21. None of GLOBAL, its directors, officers, agents or employees are liable for any acts of whatever nature, omissions or defaults whether negligent or otherwise of ME or any third parties providing services in connection with this Agreement except where liability results from the wilful default or misconduct of GLOBAL, its directors, officers, agents or employees. I agree to indemnify GLOBAL, its directors, officers, agents and employees against all liability resulting from acts or omissions of ME with respect to this Agreement or any third parties providing services in connection with this Agreement howsoever arising and whether within Canada or overseas. GLOBAL and its directors, officers, agents, employees and partners are not liable for any sickness, injury, criminal conduct, hindered travel, death, acts of war or acts of nature that may result in loss or damage to ME throughout any stage of MY trip.</p>
<p><strong>Agreement</strong></p>
<p>22. This Agreement is the entire Agreement and understanding between ME and GLOBAL on anything connected with the subject matter of this Agreement and I have entered into this Agreement without relying on any representation whatsoever by GLOBAL or by any person purporting to represent GLOBAL.</p>
<p>23. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid that part shall be severed from this Agreement and the remainder of this Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable and termination of this Agreement will not end those provisions that are capable of surviving the ending of this Agreement.</p>
<p>24. I will ask GLOBAL before signing this Agreement should I have any questions. Voluntary ignorance will not release ME from MY contractual obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>25. This Agreement is governed by the laws of Canada.</p>
